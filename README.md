# Online Diamond Marketplace Project - February Code Jam

This project was created as part of TripleTen‚Äôs **February Code Jam**, a collaborative challenge completed with two other graduates. The dataset used comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and represents data from an **online diamond marketplace**, containing key attributes of diamonds such as carat, cut, clarity, color, and price.

## üîç Project Objective

The goal of this project was to uncover actionable insights from diamond marketplace data using data visualization. The team split the analysis into sections to ensure thorough exploration and insight generation.

My primary focus was **Proportional Analysis of Diamonds**, which involved:

- Analyzing how diamond characteristics (such as cut, clarity, and carat) relate to price.
- Creating visualizations to understand proportional relationships within the dataset.
- Identifying patterns and anomalies in pricing across different diamond categories.

## üìä Tools Used

- **Tableau** for all visualizations and dashboard development
- **Excel/Google Sheets** for initial data exploration and cleaning (if needed)

## üìà My Contribution

I was responsible for the **proportional analysis** portion of the dashboard. Key contributions include:

- Visualizing average price per carat segmented by cut and clarity.
- Analyzing the distribution of diamonds by size and quality.
- Highlighting how diamond characteristics impact value proportionally.

## üë• Team Collaboration

This was a group effort with two other analysts from the TripleTen community. Each member focused on a different perspective of the diamond dataset to ensure comprehensive analysis. This README reflects my individual contribution to the broader group project.
